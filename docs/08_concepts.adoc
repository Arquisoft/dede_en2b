== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

|Concept|Description
|_user (Order)_|The attribute user in the Order entity refers to the webId of the user. Regarding users, we only store their webId in hexadecimal form tied to the order.
|_image (Product)_|We store the image as a link to an external site where it is stored.
|_Rating_|Users can leave a review consisting of a comment and a numerical rating in every existing product through the product detail view.
|_user (Rating)_|Ratings can be anonymous, in that situation, "user" value is "Guest". In case the user is logged in, "user" contains the name stored in the POD.
|_status (Order)_|Makes reference to the shipping status. It has three possible values: "PROCESSING", "SHIPPED" and "RECEIVED".

=== _User experience_

.Our intention is to make the user interface as intuitive as possible. To achieve it, we follow the usual standars of e-commerce websites:
* The shopping cart is at the upper-right corner, represented with the typical cart icon.
* Login is at the left of the cart.
* DeDe logo takes to the home page.
* Order detail view has a status progress bar to make it easy to see in which state the order is and what is left to be received.
* Checkout process follows the usual steps: order overview, payment and order completed message.
* Side bar button in the upper-left corner and contains direct links to the homepage and products accesible from anywhere.
* Footer at the bottom with About us page and links to resources relevant to the project.

The entire web is in English, but to make it accesible to more users, the idea would be to internationalize it in the future, specially in Spanish.

=== _Security_

Users do not create an account in DeDe website, they have all their information stored in their own POD. We only store the address and postal code when an order is made to guarantee delivery of the purchased products. Besides, such information is tied to the order and never used for any other purpose. WebId is also saved with the order to allow users to check their order history and current order status. In case there is no address in the POD, a direct way to add one is provided through the website, but always with the permission of the user and storing only the information they provide for that purpose.
