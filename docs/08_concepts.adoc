== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

|Concept|Description
| _POD_ | Stores the user information following Solid specification.
| _User_| Represents the client logged in. Its information will be accessed through its POD.
| _Order_| List of CartItems that has been ordered once or that is in the Cart at the moment with the total price.
| _Cart_| Contains the Order to be ordered in the current session.
| _CartItem_| Units of a specific Item that is in the order with the total price.
| _Item_| Food product available to buy.

=== _User experience_

Our intention is to make the user interface as intuitive as possible, following the usual standars of the e-commerce webs. 
To achieve it, cart is at the upper-right corner, login at the left of the cart, page-navigation at the left, etc. 

The entire web is in English.

=== _Security_

We are not storing information about the user. Instead, we access it through the POD the user provides us, so we only have the necessary information at the right time.

=== _Additional libraries_
