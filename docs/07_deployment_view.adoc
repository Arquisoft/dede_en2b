== Deployment View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. the technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. the mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document the deployment view when your software is executed as distributed system with more then one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture those elements of the infrastructure that are needed to show the deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe the infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence your system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, you need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe the highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section you will
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than the deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

*  the distribution of your system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .. as well as the physical connections between them
*  important justification or motivation for this deployment structure
* Quality and/or performance features of the infrastructure
*  the mapping of software artifacts to elements of the infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy that section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Motivation::
 
The motivation of this project is to have a functional webapp deployed. 
 
For this purpose we will use Azure.
The application is deployed by using GitHub actions over ssh and docker, since there is a container for each of the elements that are inside the VM:
*   WebApp: with React
*   Restapi: in SpringBoot
*   Database: using MySQL
 
Github Actions and SSH::
 
Github actions is a series of scripts executed inside a virtual machine on github, you can even set up docker containers or databases (although they are short lived). An example could be to set up a database before running the test that the restapi has.
 
We are using GitHub actions for automating the process described above. We connect to the VM instance using SSH and deploy the application inside it with Docker.
 
Github actions provides us with the hability to execute the deployment each time a new release is made, we can also change this for making it when a commit is added or a pull request is issued.
 
The code for this workflow is inside .github/workflows in asw2122.yml. Moreover, since the default implementation was supposed for Nodejs and, because we are using SpringBoot, we had to add new actions.
 
 
 
 
Docker::
Each of the containers has its own DockerFile with the instructions needed for creating the images. There are only two, for the webapp and the restapi, because we are using a mysql image from the marketplace. 
The ports for each image are the following (refering to the internal and external ports, they have the same value to avoid complications):
* WebApp -> 3000:3000
* RestApi -> 5000:5000
* DataBase -> 3306:3306
 
  
 
Azure::
Azure is the provider for this project, we are using an EC2 VM instance. Other alternatives are Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, etc. Nowadays all of them offer pretty much the same service and the hability to change between different providers with ease.
