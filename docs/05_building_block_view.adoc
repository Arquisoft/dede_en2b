== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

* an overview diagram
* a motivation for the decomposition
* black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


* (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

=== Scope and context

Motivation::

The user creates and interacts with its own Pod and with de DeDe system. The DeDe system has access to the user's pod.

| Building block | Description
| _DeDe_ | Online retail system that preserves the privacy of its users by following the SOLID principles.
| _User's Pod_ | The user's Pod is where the user stores its data to control it.
| _User_| Person accessing to the DeDe system and that has its own Pod.
|===

=== Level 1

Motivation::

The DeDe system is expanded in order to give more details about its internal implementation

| Building block         | Description
| _Frontend_ | The part that is seen by the user when using the application.
| _Backend_ | The part of the application that deals with its logic and communicates with the database.
| _Database_ | Database used by the DeDe system to store the needed information, such as the orders done, the addresses, etc. In our case we will use a MySQL database.

|===

=== Level 2

Motivation::

The frontend and the backend are expanded to give a further insight into its composition

| Building block         | Description
| _Views (GUI)_     | Contains all the user interfaces of the online shop. The user interacts with them to see and select products, visualize past orders and confirm the purchase, among others.
| _Controller (RestAPI)_ | It is implemented following the RestAPI architecture. Responds to user events in the views by invoking corresponding actions in the model. It is an intermediary.
| _Model_     | Implements all the business logic needed. Accesses the database to retrieve products and clients and to register orders.
Besides, it obtains clients' addresses from their PODs.
